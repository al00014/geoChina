Description: In China the digital maps use two main Geographic Coordinate
    Systems (GCSs), namely GCJ-02 and BD-09, rather than the well known WGS-84
    because of information security. geoChina provides functions for the mutual
    coordinate conversions between those three GCSs. Therefore, when geocoding
    address or reverse geocoding latitude/longitude location by calling either
    Google or Baidu Geocoding API, geoChina allows for inputting or outputting
    the coordinates in the GCS different from the one that Google or Baidu map
    uses.
